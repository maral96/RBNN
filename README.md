# RBNN: Rotated Binary Neural Network application on medical images


Binary Neural networks (BNNs) have shown remarkable performance in reducing deep neural networks' computational costs in image vision tasks such as classification and object detection. Unlike neural networks, which use a full precision format(32 bits) for model parameters, in BNN, all model parameters are binary. Therefore, the heavy floating-point calculations in convolutional layers are replaced with fast and efficient binary operations. Advantages are reduced computational cost, increased speed, and lower memory storage demand. In this paper, we use an existing but novel BNN model, the Rotated Binary Neural Network (RBNN) model, to efficiently classify histopathological images. RBNN attempts to minimize the amount of information loss that results from quantization and mapping parameters from a continuous range to a binary. We apply RBNN to tackle this challenge of quantization error in BNNs by minimizing the angular bias between the binarized and full precision floating-point formats of model weights. Our approach improves inference speed by roughly 10 times and memory storage by 21 times. Thus, BNNs are promising solutions in histopathology settings to accelerate clinical diagnosis and overcome the challenge of limited hardware resources in mid-size pathology clinics. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that BNNs have been investigated for the medical imaging domain.
